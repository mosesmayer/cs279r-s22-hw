# Todo app using Svelte and Firebase
This app adapts the tutorial at [https://fireship.io/lessons/svelte-v3-overview-firebase/](https://fireship.io/lessons/svelte-v3-overview-firebase/) for use with Firebase 9, which shifted away from a dot-chained namespace service pattern to a more modular SDK. Seems like this was done to make webapps using Firebase much smaller and faster.


Before running, use `npm install` to install required dependencies.
To run, `cd` into the project folder and use `npm run dev` (will be hosted on localhost).
